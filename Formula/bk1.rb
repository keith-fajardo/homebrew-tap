# Template for the bk1 Homebrew formula.
#
# This is the SOURCE OF TRUTH. The `homebrew` job in
# .github/workflows/release.yml substitutes the @@...@@ placeholders with each
# `v*` release's version + per-platform sha256 and pushes the result to the tap
# repo (github.com/keith-fajardo/homebrew-tap) as Formula/bk1.rb — which is
# what `brew install keith-fajardo/tap/bk1` reads.
#
# Placeholders: 0.4.14  9e2662fec9c7de2317ebf48321abedec234c3ce242eb46e95e1667a607190d78  097bbb64be88f7f46f2e5f10fc760b2362d1ff72fbbda504b8ae14c574a40f8f  a3c5d772e49539ec9ba6d8ceb64b24bfd6710e37debf9ed00c8231b0d9bdcad1

    # sidecars sibling-of-binary at runtime (see src/bk1-home.ts). Symlinking

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      bk1 needs an Anthropic API key (prompted on first run, stored at
      ~/.bk1/auth.json) and a dbt project on disk. Launch it from inside a
      project that contains dbt_project.yml, or point it anywhere with:

        DBT_PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/dbt-project bk1
    EOS
  end

  test do
    # bk1 itself launches a full-screen TUI, so exercise the lint sidecar,
    # which has a non-interactive --help and proves the tarball laid out right.
    assert_predicate libexec/"bk1-lint", :exist?
    assert_predicate libexec/"kimball/kimball.db", :exist?
    system libexec/"bk1-lint", "--help"
